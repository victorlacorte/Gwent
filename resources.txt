When performing a GET on /v0/cards with the "requests" library, the attribute
   "headers" will contain a "Last-Modified" key. Use this key and perform
   caching with a "Date"-like key (or one provided from the library
   email.utils.formatdate and the call formatdate(timeval=None, localtime=None,
   usegmt=True))

Another way of performing such task is to curl the cards URL
